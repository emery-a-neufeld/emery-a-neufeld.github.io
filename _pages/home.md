I am a posdoctoral researcher in the Theory and Logic Group at the Technical University of Vienna, working on the project [TAIGER](https://taiger.logic.at/). My research focuses on the integration of normative reasoning capabilities into autonomous agents; specifically, I am interested in working with hybrid agents that utilize both reinforcement learning and formal methods for normative reasoning to achieve normative behaviour. For a more extensive discussion of my research interests, see [here]({% link _pages/research.md %}).
