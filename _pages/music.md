Though I was trained in classical piano and guitar, in recent years I have gravitated toward composing glitch and electroacoustic music, and I have a number of different musical projects both completed or ongoing under the name "beach glass".


## solo work

For the last fifteen years, I've been experimenting with composing electronic music, which eventually evolved into a blend of glitch and elecroacoustic elements, often with a sort of melodic bent to it.

You can find my album Is/Was on [bandcamp](https://beach-glass.bandcamp.com/album/is-was), but I have a lot more sketches and first drafts on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/beach-glass) (though I haven't updated it in several years). I'm in the early stages of compiling a new album, but I don't know when that will come out.


## soundtracks

Over the years I've teamed up with artists, filmmakers, and video game developers for some really fun multi-media projects - you can find some of my collaborative projects below. If you are interested in a collaboration, let me know! 


#### over the island

In late 2022 and 2023, I worked with Marianne Thodas on her film *Over the Island*. 


#### shiromino

Though currently on hiatus, I've had a great time working on soundtracks and sound effects for the open source puzzle game *Shiromino*. Not much of what I have done is available online yet, but the game can be found [here](https://github.com/shiromino/shiromino).


#### milkteeth

One of my first collaborations was back in 2015 with the exquisite visual artist Melissa Johns. I provided the audio for her work [Milkteeth](https://melissajohns.com/milkteeth.html).
