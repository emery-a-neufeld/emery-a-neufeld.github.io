I have some other projects I'm working on in my free time.

### auroralert

To make it easier to see catch a glimpse of the aurora, I've built an aurora alert system that alerts you when the aurora should be visible in your location, [auroralert](https://github.com/lexeree/auroralert). Right now, I only have a command line tool available, but as soon as I manage to figure out Android Studio, I'll be putting out an app for it as well.
