I received my bachelor's degree in mathematics and philosophy from the University of British Columbia in 2014, and went on to work for a year as a data analyst before studying pure mathematics as a master's student at the University of Waterloo in 2015/2016. After a few years as a data scientist and business intelligence developer, near the end of 2018 I began my doctoral studies at the Doctoral College for Resilient Embedded Systems at the Technical University of Vienna, in the Faculty of Informatics, under the supervision of [Ezio Bartocci](http://www.eziobartocci.com/) and [Agata Ciabattoni](https://www.logic.at/staff/agata/). Since defending my dissertation in May 2023, I have been employed at the Technical University of Vienna as a postdoctoral researcher.

When I'm not doing research, I spend my time on music, creative writing, hiking, and watching the Lord of the Rings extended editions. My goals in life include adopting several large Alaskan malamutes and building a Dobsonian telescope.
